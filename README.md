# BattleCats
Battle Cats is a team project implementing a multiplayer game inspired by Battle City. Up to four players compete against each other, trying to be the last one standing. The project follows a client-server architecture.  
Personal contributions: player movement logic, player elimination, bullet shooting mechanism, synchronizing player actions between the client and server.
